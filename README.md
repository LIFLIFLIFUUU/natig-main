# ts-node-starter-kit-with-mongo

a starter kit for node with full typescript support and bare mongodb

This is a simple starter kit for a Node.js project using TypeScript. It includes a basic setup for TypeScript, Nodemon, and a tsconfig.json file. 

The starter kit is structured with a `src` folder for your source files and a `dist` folder for the compiled JavaScript files. The `main.ts` file is the entry point for your application.

To use this starter kit, you can clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, you can run `npm run dev` to start the project in development mode using Nodemon. Alternatively, you can run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript and then run `npm start` to start the project in production mode.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this starter kit to fit your needs!
